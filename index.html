              Hello!
              <br><br>
              I'm passionate about technology, great music, great stories, and the great outdoors (you'd be surprised at the overlap between them all).
              If I'm not banging my head against the wall working on some new project, you'll usually find me running up a mountain or skiing down one.
              <br><br>
              I'm trying the best I can to explore the PNW and all its natural beauty.
              I'm always looking for new places to explore and people to do so with, let me know if you're interested. 
              <br><br>
              I finished my undergraduate degree at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill in May 2019,
              leaving with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. 
              I then moved to Seattle, WA to start my career as a Software Engineer focusing on backend and search technologies.
              In 2024/2025, I took a quick 'break' to complete a MSc. in Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington. Where
              I conducted research with the Data Science in Hydrology group analyzing the impact of climate change on the Pacific Northwest’s water resources, notably in
              the Skagit River Basin.
              <br><br>
              If you're interested in what I'm working on or what I've done in the past, be sure to check out my résumé and other links below.
