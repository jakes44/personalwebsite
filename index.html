              Hello!
              <br><br>
              I'm passionate about technology, music, and good stories (you'd be surprised at the overlap between them all).
              If I'm not banging my head against the wall working on some new project, you'll usually find me at a concert or doing the crossword.
              <br><br>
              Lately, I've been doing a lot of running, hiking, and biking -- exploring the PNW and all its natural beauty. It's a lot fun.
              I'm always looking for new places to explore and people to do so with, let me know if you're interested. 
              <br><br>
              I finished my undergraduate degree at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill in May 2019,
              leaving with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. 
              Afterwards, I moved to Seattle, WA to start my career as a Software Development Engineer.
              <br><br>
              If you're interested in what I'm working on or what I've done in the past, be sure to check out my résumé and other links below.
